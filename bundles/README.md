## Build a new Docker bundle for Ubuntu 16.04

When Ubuntu updates their base system packages it can break the dependencies specified by packages in our Docker bundle.
Usually this is the `perl-base` package getting a new security patch, and the packages in our bundle expect the older version.
When this happens we need to rebuild the Docker bundle for Ubuntu.

First use CircleCI's API to trigger a new build and push
```
curl -u ${CIRCLE_CI_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build_ubuntu_docker_package \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/tree/master \
```

Then update chatops deployer with the new image tag. No code changes are required in this repo.

## Build a new Docker bundle for RHEL 7.4 and 7.5

```
curl -u ${CIRCLE_CI_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build_rhel_docker_package \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/tree/master
```

Then update chatops deployer with the new image tag. No code changes are required in this repo.

## Build new K8s package for Ubuntu 16.04

```
curl -u ${CIRCLE_CI_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build_ubuntu_k8s_packages \
     -d build_parameters[K8S_VERSION]=v1.11.5 \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/tree/master
```

Update chatops deployer with the new image tags.
Update the Ubuntu image tags [in this repo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/blob/77654150c6a6d4e80b9b1f24f8fb2d63b412d7ea/install_scripts/templates/common/kubernetes.sh#L2)

## Build new K8s package for RHEL 7.4 and 7.5

```
curl -u ${CIRCLE_CI_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build_rhel_k8s_packages \
     -d build_parameters[K8S_VERSION]=v1.15.12 \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/tree/master
```

Update chatops deployer with the new image tags.
Update the RHEL image tags [in this repo](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/blob/77654150c6a6d4e80b9b1f24f8fb2d63b412d7ea/install_scripts/templates/common/kubernetes.sh#L6)

## Build new K8s container image bundles for all supported versions of K8s

This will package up images such as `kube-apiserver` used on every OS for airgap installs.
This should only be needed when adding a new supported version of K8s.

```
curl -u ${CIRCLE_CI_TOKEN}: \
     -d build_parameters[CIRCLE_JOB]=build_k8s_bundles \
     -d build_parameters[K8S_VERSION]=v1.15.12 \
     https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/tree/master
```

Update chatops deployer with the new image tags.
Each image in the created bundle will need to be [retagged with its full name](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-installer/blob/77654150c6a6d4e80b9b1f24f8fb2d63b412d7ea/install_scripts/templates/common/kubernetes.sh#L209).
